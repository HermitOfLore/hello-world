# hello world
 a little place to explore ideas
hi my name's atticus, an english student with an interest in programming and video games.
my goals are to go to grad school to study literary theory, do freelance programming and game devving by night, work as an editor by day and either open a used bookstore or work as a librarian...not necessarily in that order or all at once, but anything's possible i suppose
